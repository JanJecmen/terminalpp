# TODOs

- when mouse is not used, mouse selection should be possible
- clearing the buffer does not seem to be enough, better still, last character in a row should always clear the stuff right off
- when mc exists first key is swallowed
- cursor blinking in X11
- when terminal is resized, try to keep stuff in the buffer
- improve logging
- proper UTF8 and UTF32 conversion in helpers::strings
